1. Content guidelines: 
    1. Make it feel real. Do not use dummy text. Make sure images and text are working well together and make a coherent piece of content. Any media needs to be CC0 licensed.
    2. If using custom colors make sure to use actual HEX values, not the theme defined names (do not click on the color swatches, input HEX values manually instead). Double check the code - if you input HEX code of a color that is defined in the theme, the custom name will be used instead.
    3. If using background color, be sure to explicitly define the text color too. This is to ensure that the text remains readable on sites using both light and dark color schemes.
2. Put the block pattern through it’s paces:
    1. Test on both simple and atomic site.
    2. Test with Twenty Twenty and Varia child themes using both light and dark color scheme.
3. Create a new issue in block patterns this repo. The issue should include:
    1. A screenshot of the pattern.
    2. Code snippet copied directly from the editor. Triple check there aren’t any empty paragraphs in the code (common issue).
    3. A few words on your reasoning (nice to have).
4. Gather team feedback. Ping people if necessary.
5. If the feedback is positive and there are no issues with the code: 
    1. Add the pattern to the master site (https://dotcompatterns.wordpress.com/) as a new post. Select "Pattern" as the cateogry. Hit publish.
    2. If the pattern is using images, make sure those images are added to the media library on the master site.
        1. Images should be no bigger than 2000px (width or height, whichever is bigger) and optimised.
    3. Add “added to dotcompatterns” label to the corresponding GH issue.
6. [TO DO - Block deploy process]
